# Note for translators:

The figma / pixelmator files do *not* need to be translated. If you wish to you can, though the pdf containing a collection of badger text is all that really needs translated at the moment.

# PRs:

The recommended way of translations is putting them in a translations folder, giving your translation a name such as 'Badger1.2-French-Translation-(name)' - though honestly unless you overwrite any files here or any other files to be PR'd, I really don't care all that much and will likely accept your translation PR.
