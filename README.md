# Note for translators:

The figma / pixelmator files do *not* need to be translated, and I don't recommend doing so considering most of it is just showcasing how some external was designed for Badger, ex screenshots shown in reddit posts, havoc banner etc. What is for translating though is the Badger 1.2 Translation Doc PDF I have provided on this repo, which contains text from Badger 1.2 that needs translating, along with some images to help context. If you wish to get more images for context for your Badger translation, let me know. 

You don't *need* to PR a translation here, if you wish to do it another way, and I recommend stating how you would like to be credited - if you don't state how I really can only link to how you sent it over ex github / twitter dms etc. I also recommend to remain in contact so once your translation gets accepted I can gift you the tweak on Havoc. Also note that if you want to, I can exclude you from credits if you desire, so if you don't wish to be credited, tell me and I won't credit you publicly.

# PRs:

The recommended way of translations is putting them in a translations folder, giving your translation a name such as 'Badger1.2-French-Translation-(name)' - though honestly unless you overwrite any files here or any other files to be PR'd, I really don't care all that much and will likely accept your translation PR.

# Reporting mistakes in translations:

It's recommended to most of the time submit an issue if a translation has a mistake in it and to mention the mistake in the issue. However if a translation is wildly innacurate and you can provide a better translation to PR the translation and mention innacuracies. It may also be beneficial if you know other people knowing your language to support it being mistranslated, though while highly recommended it is not a requirement, especially for minor fixes.
